CHEMICAL ENGINEERING 502 (APC 502)
Mathematical Methods of Engineering Analysis II
Homework 7
DUE: Friday, December 14, in class;
exercise 4 can be given/emailed any time WITHIN 2012 !
1. 7.12
2. To do 7.17 you need to use information about Bessel-type
eigenproblems; this is contained in section 7.5, but uses
material from Chapter 4 that we did not do in detail. So I
want you to read on your own Section 4.16 (enough of it
to be able to solve the problem) and write me a sentence
that “you did a good effort to read and understand 4.16,
also looking up other material from Chapter 4 as
necessary” -- This should take at least as much time as
doing Exercise 3.
3. 7.17
4. IMPORTANT and different (you are encouraged to do this
in pairs, and it is acceptable to hand in “the same”
solution per pair).
I want you to solve the one-dimensional finite element
problem in the notes – to do it in MATLAB. Choose an
epsilon (let’s say 0.5), choose an f(x) and solve it
analytically first (with the methods in the book). Then, for
different number of elements in the domain (say 5, 20,
100) formulate and solve the finite element problem, and
plot how the error changes as a function of the size of the
discretization (you have to define a “good” error,
comparing with the “true” solution you found analytically
!). When I say “solve in MATLAB” I mean formulate it as
a set of linear eqations for the 5, 20, 100 unknowns, and
then ask MATLAB to solve the equations and plot the
solutions.
